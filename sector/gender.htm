		            Women, girls and children face greater risk of survival, violence, under development and discrimination, especially if they are marginalized, poor, physically challenged or if they belong to divided families. Pervasive gender inequality, inadequate power and rights, lack of economic resources, poor participation in political and public processes are some of the biggest impediments in development and empowerment of women. Children on the other hand from lower social and economic strata are at a greater risk of early survival and development, accessing education, forced labour, trafficking and abuse, and serious violation of child rights. 
<br/><br/>
Our work in this sector has been focused on technical support and research on child rights and protection, women and child development, social protection, women rights and equality, prevention of violence, access to justice, access to education and health, and gender equality. We have assisted our clients and partners in conducting in-depth studies, qualitative analysis, programme design, advocacy and institutional strengthening for equitable development of women and children.

						            The project titled "Improving education and health for deafblind people in Bangladesh" was funded by the Scottish Government during the period May 2013- March 2017. The objective was to improve education and health of children and youth with deafblindness in fifteen districts of Bangladesh and in Dhaka city. The project targeted the most marginalised individuals and families and reached out to people with deafblindness and family members who are indirectly affected. The project was managed and implemented by a consortium of organisations which comprised of Sense Scotland, Sense International (SI)- UK, Sense International India (SII), Centre for Disability in Development (CDD) and 15 in-country implementation partners. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting undertook a final evaluation of the programme with the objective of studying the impact and informing local stakeholders and funders about achievements and results as well as evaluating the overall change experienced over the course of implementation. The evaluation also assessed the extent to which the project represented value for money in its efforts to deliver results, documented lessons learnt and made recommendations for future projects and strategy.

						            The UNDP Access to Justice for Marginalised People or the A2J Project was in its second phase and over a period four years endeavoured to address some of the pertinent issues regarding the justice sector in India. It was a collaborative effort between the UNDP and the Department of Justice and comprised of multiple components including legal research and evidence gathering to strengthen policy, systematic analysis of data on crucial aspects of the judiciary to influence policy, strengthening of the justice delivery through capacity building of Legal Aid Services, imparting legal literacy through strategic institutional partnerships, conducting innovative pilots to raise legal awareness and generate demand from the grassroots. The project had a special focus on working with marginalized groups belonging to Dalit and Adivasi communities, women and children.<br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting was engaged for conducting a final evaluation of the project with a view to evaluate results and impact with a view on sustainability, identify practices that could be taken forward in the next phase for replication and scaled up, document success stories, develop a basis for decision making in the next phase and lay down a roadmap for future interventions. Our team of legal and social development experts developed innovative and strategic recommendations that aided strong grounding of future phases of the project.

						            World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development as well as country policy dialogues and programs of the World Bank were seeking inputs through studies to inform about gender differences in making economic choices. The programme aimed at capturing experiences and views of women and men in making important economic decisions for living and the gender norms surrounding these decisions and the emerging pattern of changes in these norms. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting provided insights in through its qualitative study undertaken in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, on gender differences in making economic choices in India. The team of experts skilfully highlighted subjective views of men and women, experiences with making key economic decisions, and to understand the gender norms surrounding these choices such as expansion of educational opportunities, changes in economic opportunities etc. Through work of the team the synthesis report was largely able to provide insights whether communities are progressing towards greater gender equality in all spheres of life, difference in perceived equality across urban and rural communities, influence of education and greater cultural exposure, sharing with other modern societies on gender norms; increased support role of women on economic activities of families and discriminations faced by women.

						           Women's helplines in 37 districts of Bihar have been functional for the several years (Patna district helpline being the oldest) and have reached out to several women who have required it services. With this regard, Sutra consulting was hired from June 2015 to November 2015 for performing an Outcome Assessment Study of Women's Helpline strengthened under the SWASTH programme in Bihar. There was a twofold objective for this assignment i.e. a) Conducting an assessment of the helplines in line with the objectives of the previous assessment to understand the extent to which the helplines had improved capabilities, b) Understanding the extent to which the needs of women victims were addressed and finding the related socio-cultural, health and nutrition outcomes for these women.<br/><br/>
As specific activities under this assignment, Sutra has assessed the functionalities of the helplines and individual socio-cultural and health outcomes for the women victims who accessed the helpline; observed the progress made by the helplines in achieving favourable outcomes for women and the support received by the victim and the families in resolving the issues; recorded various achievements and gaps and identified ways for effective and efficient ways for preventing violence on women and gave specific for further strengthening of the process.
