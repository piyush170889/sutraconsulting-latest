We believe effectiveness of development programs must be rigorously measured to guide evidence-based policy making and course correction of programs. Our expertise in designing monitoring and evaluation systems and implementing rigorous impact evaluationsusing both randomised control trials and quasi experimental models, have assisted in improving outcomes of several social development programs. Our in-depth experience of working with community in designing and implementing participatory monitoring systems have ensured that voices and community priorities, particularly from the poor and the marginalised groups are mainstreamed in the development strategies and decisions. Our monitoring and evaluation specialists have extensively used the power of observation to evaluate program and community engagement processes, which have led to improved systems and processes for program delivery. Our monitoring and evaluation expertise is demonstrated across sectors including agriculture, forestry, irrigation, livelihoods, tribal development, education and skill development, health, environment, microfinance and financial inclusion for a diverse group of Clients and Partners. 	</p>

				Sutra Consulting has been engaged as the Monitoring and Evaluation Agency for USD 135 million World Bank Himachal Pradesh Horticulture Development Project. This programme aims at developing the horticulture sector in the state by supporting small & marginal farmers and agro-entrepreneurs by improving producer's access to knowledge and climate resilient production technologies, promoting investments in agribusiness, fostering backward and forward linkages in the value chains and supporting the development of an improved platform for market-related information and intelligence.<br/><br/>
Through extensive field visits, our Experts have drawn insights to the working of the Project by interacting with farmers and subject matter specialists at PCU and PIU. They are currently involved in development of tools for farmer's field surveys and preparation of formats, which will be an integral a part of monitoring system in the MIS. Under this programme, we will be conducting the baseline, annual follow up, Thematic studies & mid-term impact assessment. Importantly, the key focus will be on concurrent monitoring which will quantify short-term outputs and outcomes with the focus on measuring the economic progress of the beneficiaries to ascertain the impact of the Project.

				The World Bank Rajasthan Agricultural Competitiveness Project (RACP) aims to establish the feasibility of sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and farmer incomes through a distinct agricultural development approach by integrating agriculture water management and agricultural technology, farmer organizations and market innovations in selected locations across the ten agro-ecological zones of Rajasthan.  The guiding principles under the project are: sustainable and efficient use of water resources, increased private sector participation in the development of value chains and improved public sector capacity in delivering agriculture support services. <br/>
				<br/>
Sutra Consulting is engaged to provide long term strategic monitoring and evaluation (M&E) support to the programme as part of which our team of experts is responsible for designing an M&E strategy, developing and implementing innovative participatory monitoring tools and methodologies, undertaking baseline and longitudinal assessments and conducting an end of programme impact assessment. Our work in this programme is contributing to development of capacities to track and assess change, identification of areas of improvements and recognition of good practices holding potential for scale up. Our team of advisors are developing relevant tools and methodologies which in the long run would lead to greater scope for sustainability and ownership of programme monitoring processes and system.

				Sutra Consulting is engaged as an external evaluation consultancy to conduct a baseline, mid-term assessment and final impact evaluation study of the USD 121.2 million World Bank Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project Phase (UDWDP) Phase-II project. The programme focuses on institutional and improvement in productive potential through i) increasing the water discharge, ii) increasing the biomass, and iii) increasing the rain-fed area under irrigation and specifically aims at improved decentralized governance, gender equity and environmental sustainability by mobilizing and organizing the farmers in the watershed area focussing on women producers.<br/><br/>
The baseline established a benchmark for PDO and Intermediate Indicators against which a mid-term survey and a final impact evaluation will be compared and inference on impact established. The first six monthly concurrent monitoring report outlined the physical & financial progress covering the project period from beginning till September 2017 by analysing MIS based data and undertaking interim projections on targeted results. The focus of qualitative assessment was identifying opportunities and constraints in smooth delivery of project. Select indicators were suggested for a revisit. Our Team of Experts are currently involved in finalising the second six monthly concurrent monitoring report basing on economic analysis comparing the benefits and costs to the whole economy.
