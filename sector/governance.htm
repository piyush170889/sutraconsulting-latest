		            Enhancing quality of governance in public sector institutions responsible for effective and equitable decision making and management of public resources is increasingly being recognized as a precondition for improving quality of life of citizens and for reducing poverty. Good governance must ensure greater participation of poor and marginalized in the decision-making process, promotes rule of law, ensures protection of citizens, reduces corruptions and enhances efficiency in delivery of public services. Strengthening decentralization and local governance, ensuring transparency and accountability in governance, and expanding social opportunities and elimination of poverty through good governance are some of the key challenges for the existing political system.<br/><br/>
We have extensively worked in the domain of governance, particularly in strengthening local government and have assisted our clients in policy review and strategy formulation for strengthening governance, designing performance assessment system for local governments, assessed and evaluated performance of local government in delivering services, undertaken service delivery assessments, conducted sector reviews and monitoring and evaluation of governance programmes.

						           Institutional Strengthening of Gram Panchayat Project of the World Bank aims at increasing the capacity building support system and performance based grants allocation system for all the Gram Panchayats under the West Bengal state's jurisdiction. The performance grants are to encourage the Gram Panchayats as decentralised bodies, acting more efficiently and effectively as local service delivery systems in rural areas. The programme provides assistance for the state wide implementation of the performance based grants system by strengthening the Gram panchayats. This assistance is through developing Gram Panchayats Management System, Web Based Monitoring System, Geographic Information System, expansion of video conferencing facilities, and Grievance Redressal Management System. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting provided comprehensive support in designing and implementing the Annual Performance Assessment in selected 1000 Gram Panchayats (GPs) of the 9 districts in West Bengal.  Our team was responsible for developing and testing of the assessment instruments, engagement and training of data collection and data entry staff, development and testing of the data entry system, implementation of the assessment exercise and documentation. Our assessment was used to identify GPs eligible to receive Block Grants in 2013-14, identify strengths and weaknesses of GPs and form the groundwork for the Mid-Term Appraisal and Impact Evaluation of the project.

						            District Planning is the process of preparing an integrated plan for the local government sector in a district taking into account the resources (natural, human and financial) available and covering the sectoral activities and schemes assigned to the district level and below and those implemented through local governments in a state. With the 73rd and 74th amendments of the Constitution of India, decentralization of planning is emphasized and the methodology of district plan was changed. The District Planning Process is conducted in a participatory manner as per planning commission's guidelines. The planning department has engaged Technical Support Institutions to facilitate participatory planning process undertaken by the district administration. The District Plan also includes preparation of Vision document, Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF) plan and Comprehensive District Agricultural Plan (CDAP) documents as per the guideline of government of India. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting supported Kandhamal district in Orissa for their District Plan preparation for a period two years. The district plan preparation involved consultation with all government departments, civic societies, elected representatives and the PRI members. Appropriate data collection was carried at the Gram Panchayat level and aggregated at the district level in a participatory manner. The planning document included a perspective plan for five years and an annual plan for the current year based on the Vision document developed for the district. Our experts helped the district administration prepare the District Plan on time and oriented the stakeholders in multiple workshops which helped addition of new areas such as training and skill development into the planning document and drove the administration to allocate additional funds to district specific priorities such as tourism and food
