		            Health is considered as a central concern in development with increasing realization regarding the role of health in poverty reduction and how poor health and disease creates and perpetuates poverty and undermines economic and social outcomes. The challenges in public health care system in several countries ranges from inadequate infrastructure, low government spending, shortage of healthcare professionals, rural urban disparity, and poor penetration of insurance, which accentuates the inadequate access to proper health care. These challenges are exacerbated by the issues faced in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector where drinking water supply and sanitation facilities continue to be inadequate. The issues of health and well-being are closely related to adequate water supply and functional sanitation systems and despite the progress made in the last two decades, significant inequalities in access to quality and affordable health care, and a disproportionate burden of communicable and non-communicable disease persists in several geographies. 
Our work in the health and the WASH sector is focused on technical and management assistance to programmes; monitoring and formative research in maternal and child health, urban and rural health service delivery; evaluation of community lead sanitation and quality of health services; health facility and service provider surveys; policy research and strategy for WASH and health services; regional planning for strengthening health care systems; developing advocacy and communication strategy, and monitoring and evaluation of programmes.

						            Sutra was engaged as the Baseline Survey and Impact Evaluation agency during April 2017 to August 2017 for the rural water supply and sanitation project in Uttar Pradesh supported by the Neer Nirmal Pariyojana of Government of Uttar Pradesh. This project aimed at enhancing piped drinking water supply and sanitation coverage through decentralized delivery systems. The sanitation component of the project would complement SBM (G) program, by bringing about convergence in institutional arrangements and integrating water and sanitation processes into a single scheme cycle. <br/><br/>
An impact evaluation (IE) has been carried out by Sutra to evaluate the benefits of the water supply and sanitation interventions under the project in the state which has shown significant progress in institutional development and implementation of the project and has the requisite institutional capacity to support and undertake an IE exercise. It further assessed the impact of the project interventions on social and human development outcomes as well as on hygiene and sanitation behaviour. The findings from the evaluation helped to improve the knowledge base and drive future policies in the state towards greater efficiency, sustainability, and equity of access

						           Sutra was engaged from September 2011 to December 2011 for supporting Government of Odisha for Rapid Appraisal of the Rural Water and Sanitation Sector in Odisha. The purpose of this study was to identify the weaknesses and opportunities present in making the delivery system more effective to achieve targets in an accelerated pace. The study intended to review the current practices prevalent in 4 districts in Orissa which are among the best performing and worst performing districts under the Total Sanitation Campaign. <br/><br/>
Sutra conducted household survey for this project which focused on thematic areas such as their membership in community institutions, access to toilet, functionality and usage of toilets, hygiene behaviour practice and consciousness, safe water drinking practices, access to safe water etc. The qualitative consultations at selected panchayats across 12 blocks in 4 districts explored further into the reasons of effective implementation of Total Sanitation Campaign and NRDWP. With assessment of primary data and consultations, Sutra recommended strategic path for policy and operational changes.
