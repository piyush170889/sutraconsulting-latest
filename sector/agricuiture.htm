		            The natural resource sector is confronted with several diverse and challenging issues ranging from ecological balance, food security, resource ownership and stewardship, which are highly contentious and emotive for stakeholders. The policies and effective management of natural resources must ensure a fine balance in conservation and economic use of resources in the interest of future generations. 
Our work in the natural resource management sector has contributed positively towards the efforts of our partners and clients in achieving this fine balance and in strengthening stewardship. We specialize in providing technical assistance and project management support, designing innovative research, monitoring and evaluation, training and capacity building, conducting policy reviews, economic analysis, strengthening of community institutions for participatory resource management, and using technology and GIS for resource mapping in the domains of forestry, land, agriculture and allied sectors, and watershed management to assist our partners in efficient utilization and conservation of natural resources.

						           The Maharashtra Agricultural Competitiveness Project is a USD100 million programme of the World Bank to improve agricultural competitiveness in the state by increasing productivity, profitability and market access of the farming community in Maharashtra. The project supports intensification and diversification of market-led production through agriculture technology transfer, facilitating marketing networks, improving market intelligence systems and strengthening livestock support services in the state. The project strengthens farmer's access to markets through developing alternate market opportunities, a warehouse receipts system, upgrading local rural markets, piloting e-trading platforms, and modernizing existing wholesale markets and livestock yards.<br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting provided long-term comprehensive monitoring and evaluation support to the programme, where our team of advisers were responsible for developing theory of change and evidence-based design of M&E framework and system, design of multi-stakeholder M&E strategy, developing participatory monitoring and evaluation system, conducting baseline and mid-term impact evaluation studies, undertaking semi-annual and annual results or outcome monitoring, and developing capacities of the project to monitor and track progress of project outcomes and impacts. Our work in the programme lead to a better understanding of the wide-ranging impact of the programme, particularly in improving agricultural productivity, better prices realisation for small and marginal farmers with improved access to market, minimising post harvesting losses with greater adoption of post-harvest management technology, improved transparency and efficiency in trading through modernised agricultural markets, minimising distress sale through improved warehousing and warehouse receipt facilities, and overall improved return from agriculture and allied sectors for farmers in Maharashtra.

						            The Bihar Agriculture Growth and Reforms Initiative Programme of theDepartment for International Development aims to support Government of Bihar in enabling sustained and inclusive agricultural growth leading to poverty reduction. The purpose of the programme is to improve the performance of agriculture sector in Bihar significantly to reflect higher private sector investment, higher production and higher price realisation by farmers. This performance improvement initiative aims to improve access to markets for identified agriculture and horticulture products, access to finance, knowledge and technology, and institutional capacity for market regulation. This will reflect higher private sector investment, higher production and higher price realisation by farmers. <br/><br/>
