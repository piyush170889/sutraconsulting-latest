		         Our expertise in conducting rigorous research to influence poverty reduction policies, program design, reforms program for the rural sector, social and gender strategies, governance and public service delivery have made social programs more effective, strengthened pro-poor service delivery and influenced gender inclusiveness. Our policy and social development experts have extensively used participatory techniques to understand narratives of poverty, exclusion, discrimination and political economy to suggest policies and strategic options for overcoming them. We strongly believe in and pursue mixed method approach in our policy and social research and are convinced that social strategies must be based on strong evidence, with a deeper understanding of inherent multidimensionality of poverty and social norms that influence human outcomes. Our work in economic research focuses on micro, small and medium enterprises, labour market assessment, market linkages, measurement of economic impact and benefits, urban planning and economic analysis in program design.

				For the period of January 2015 to February 2015, Sutra was engaged as the Technical Assessment agency for the Rural Sanitation Program in Odisha and West Bengal supported by The World Bank through water Sanitation Program (WSP). This project aims for advancing the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan-Gramin in 5 states of the country, Odisha, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. SBM-G has the objective of achieving ODF-free status by providing toilets to all households in the country by 2019, provide toilets in all the Anganwadis, and separate toilets for boys and girls in all the schools in the country by August 15, 2016, and promote cleanliness in the all the villages through management of solid and liquid waste. WSP is considering support to the SBM-G and in the course of making preparations for the project, it is taking up a series of assessments, including Environmental assessment, Fiduciary assessment and Technical Assessment (TA).<br/><br/>
As Technical Assessment Agency, Sutra is responsible for Developing strategic institutional arrangements, expenditure framework, results framework and disbursement linked indicators, and undertaking economic evaluation.  Further,  on the basis of the above assessments Sutra in close consultation with respective State or National government and the World Bank team formulated conclusions and recommendations regarding the (a) actions to be undertaken with Bank support during preparation and implementation to address selected areas for improvement; (b) the definition of the scope and form of technical support during implementation; and (c) the key technical risks to the Program not achieving its expected results as inputs to the integrated risk assessment for the operation

				One of the initial livelihood improve projects in India was the 130 million USD Chhattisgarh District Poverty Reduction Project. It aimed to improve opportunities for the poor and vulnerable, especially women and tribal, for social and economic development. Broadly, the project focussed on creating infrastructure and income opportunities for the rural poor; and empower vulnerable and disadvantaged people through Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). The Project empowered active groups of disadavanteged people; and supported village governments in becoming more responsive and effective in assisting them. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting conducted a policy research on tribal land for the Project specifically looking into modalities of land transfer from tribal communities in Chhattisgarh. The research generated a typology of various processes of tribal land alienation in Chhattisgarh, and explored their impacts on people's livelihoods, their interaction with laws for protection of tribal people, the effectiveness of these laws and possible means to improve access of scheduled tribes to land. <br/><br/>
Our research helped the Project understand the typologies of tribal land alienation and the consequences of land alienation for tribal livelihoods and welfare. The study assisted the Project and policy making bodies assess the causes and modalities of tribal land alienation and initiate dialogues to initiate changes in legal and regulatory framework that would guarantee, restore and enforce tribal land rights.

				National Rural Livelihood Project is a US$ 1171.00 million programme of the World Bank targeted to be implemented in 150 selected districts of 10 high-priority states of India. The intervention targets to improve rural livelihood interventions i.e. Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh and three new states: Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. The project aims to strengthen people's institutions to achieve social inclusion in all dimensions of the program through mobilization, institution-building, capacity building, financial, economic and social services, livelihoods, and so on. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting provided comprehensive support to the programme where our team of experts were responsible to hold consultations with the primary, and most relevant secondary stakeholders of NRLP to inform the design and implementation of the NRLP as a socially inclusive and culturally appropriate program. Our work in the programme led to inform a better understanding of institutions operating in remote and LWE affected areas and provide operational recommendations for the social management framework for the NRLP. This has led to a more inclusive programme design for NRLP focussing highly on social inclusion processes to ensure comprehensive participation in the programme.

				The Himachal Pradesh Development Policy Loan (DPL) by World Bank to Promote Inclusive Green Growth and Sustainable Development proposes innovative reforms that support the GoHP to make a paradigm shift toward a socially and environmentally sustainable economic growth model. The programme supports reforms at both macro and micro level where contribution is towards ongoing transformation of the state's economy in building secondary, tertiary and infrastructure sectors while providing a new impetus to growth in a context of high environmental consciousness and cohesive social organization. At micro level the reforms will be shared with local populations through a range of community schemes, which will have the effect of redistributing the gains from macroeconomic reforms and mitigating the impact of negative spillovers.<br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting provided research insights on the nature and extent of micro level impact as a result of the reforms on community across various social and economic dimensions and would capture changes and effect experienced by the different groups, particularly the poor and vulnerable. Our experts were responsible for conducting consultations with communities who were affected by the Hydel power project and Mid Himalayan Watershed Projects. The research tools were designed by the experts and focus group discussions were carried out in different pockets of 4 districts of Himachal Pradesh. Our work in programme has led to derive recommendations separately for hydropower and watershed reform projects. The recommendations where in the line of improving local infrastructure with positive impact on community, on groups to be targeted for receiving benefits out of local employment and demand for local services, differential impact on household welfare, influence on the dynamics of social change, impact on productivity and ecology and longer term impact on household welfare.
