		            The energy sector is facing serious challenges due to economic and population growth resulting in more use of fossil fuel dependent energy, which in turn is creating severe pressure on natural resources and environment. The increasing CO2 emissions and oil demand is predicted to create irreversible changes in the environment unless renewable sources of energy are adequately harnessed and used. Environmental problems that deplete natural resources and strain livelihoods are increasing as a result of pollution, fossil fuel combustion, improper waste disposal and climate change. It is predicted that climate change would affect the environment dramatically and would have unprecedented impact on communities and on natural resources such as agriculture, fisheries, energy, tourism and water that are primary sources of livelihoods.
We have assisted our clients and partners on range of issues concerning climate change and sustainable development focusing on environment conservation and natural resource management, social and environment impact assessment (SEIA) for programmes, preparation and monitoring of social and environmental management framework (SEFM), developing climate change action plans, developing climate change adaptability strategy for natural resource sectors, development of disaster preparedness and management plan, promotion of renewable energy, identification and development of CDM projects and business models on low carbon strategy.

						           Discussions around the fast depletion of energy reserves have come into the foreground since the last few years. There is a growing realisation that complete dependence on conventional energy sources would have disastrous consequences. Oxfam India's overall Theory of Change laid down a goal to  Increase Access to Appropriate Renewable Sources by Tribal and other Forest Dependent Communities. In line with this goal, Oxfam India proposed to design and implement a campaign to build a just and equitable energy future based on sustainable alternatives and energy efficiency in a carbon constrained world: mainstreaming renewable energy; holding public investments and governments accountable and addressing energy poverty of marginalized communities. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting was engaged to conduct an online perception survey among a selected profile of respondents residing in a state capital. The purpose of the survey was to develop an understanding of the level of awareness and sensitivity of residents of the city toward the issue of renewable energy. The findings of the survey were used as a basis for developing an awareness campaign on the issue of renewable energy.

						            Sutra as a consortium member was engaged during 2014-15 for providing technical support to the World Bank supported Climate Resilient and Carbon Conscious Growth in Odisha Project. Odisha was one of the first states in India to formulate a State Climate Change Action Plan (SCAP) in 2010 based on the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC). A Climate Change Cell was set up in the state's Forest and Environment Department to lead the process for coordinating and implementing the SCAP in a systemic manner.  The SCAP addressed both climate change adaptation as well as mitigation and dedicated pillar to address issues in urban areas. The SCAP consisted of series of actions in 11 priority sectors including, investments, institutional strengthening and coordination mechanisms as well as the needs of capacity building and knowledge generating activities.<br/><br/>
Sutra deployed efficient man-force  for providing local coordination in Bhubaneswar and  Cuttack for the formation of project working group committees; organising and moderating workshops; carrying out factual and cost benefit analysis of urban resilient investment options for both cities;  preparing project design in consultation with  the partner agency; assessment of gaps to evaluate the need for augmenting existing measures in terms of vulnerability and risk assessment; reviewing budgetary frameworks; assessing ability of existing/planned measures to address the vulnerability and risk reduction needs; and identifying possible adaptation measures including prevention, preparedness, mitigation of impacts, response, awareness and sensitization.

						            DFID provided technical support to the maiden and biggest power sector reforms project in India in Orissa during 1996-2000. As a follow-up few utilities tried to experiment community led rural distribution management that could possibly improve electricity distribution, revenue and collections. The project demonstrated a way of providing and sustaining electricity services through the private sector to poor rural communities in Orissa, within a privatised power sector. The project aimed to facilitate community level interventions to establish electricity committees in villages that are connected to the grid and create an institutional linkage between these communities based user institutions and the utility to improve electricity supply services in rural areas.<br/><br/>
DFID provided financial assistance for this concept and Xavier Institute of Management was the lead implementing agency which engaged Sutra Consulting for part of delivery. Our team was involved in the project planning, management and monitoring and evaluation of the project that includes establishing baseline information and social indicators, facilitating formation of village electricity committee and their capacity building to enable them to operate for improving electricity services, provide field support to strengthen utility at the local level for system improvement in villages, and conducting social audit and assessment of livelihood improvement due to improved access of electricity services in 900 villages of two western Orissa districts.

						            Community Based Drought Response Project (CBDRP) was implemented in select blocks in Bolangir, Phulbani and Gajapati districts in Orissa by CARE India to improve livelihood of communities severely threatened by drought each year. This was part of CARE India's work in the domain of disaster management. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting provided technical support to various partner agencies in Phulbani district on site identification, feasibility and handholding on land and water conservation practices. Our experts were involved reviewing the feasibility plan of water impounding structures, designing structural feasibility of sites, monitoring and technical input during implementation, developing and conducting training programme for partner agencies and communities during the project.
