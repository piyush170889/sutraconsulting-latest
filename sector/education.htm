		           Improving quality of human resources through education and skill development is prerequisite for human advancement and for achieving sustainable development. The progress towards "Education for All" still remains a challenge with unequal access to schools, inadequate infrastructure in rural areas, and poor quality and high cost of education. While considerable progress has been made in primary education, enrollment at the secondary level and progression to university education remains low in many countries. Skill development to address skill divide and for improving employability and labour market participation is receiving greater attention where quality of secondary and university education is inadequate. <br/><br/>
Our work in the education sector has been focused on assisting our clients in undertaking learning assessments, teacher's training and pedagogical improvement, quantitative and qualitative impact assessment of educational interventions, assessing teaching effectiveness, developing advocacy strategy and designing communication materials. In the domain of skill development and training our work has assisted in project management of skill development programmes, labour market and enterprise surveys, skill gap analysis, vocational and skill training need assessment, and technical support for monitoring and evaluation of skill development programmes.

						           Odisha Girls' Incentive Programme (OGIP's) by DFID aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the national scholarship scheme for SC and ST children for secondary education through robust implementation structure and system improvement, community wide mobilization and outreach, conditional cash transfer of national scholarship on achievement of 70% attendance, supporting additional cash transfer to girls and full scholarship to SC & ST children ineligible due to household income cap, and implementation of region specific pilot programmes to address specific constraints to secondary education 
Sutra Consulting along with its partner, engaged as a Research and Evaluation Agency contributed in making a robust evaluation for OGIP's Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Program and innovative pilots such as learning hub and safe transport pilots. The team of experts has developed specific methodology and design for evaluation of the various components under the programme i.e. CCT, Community Mobilisation, the learning hubs, School Transport and other experimental pilots. Further, it has also refined and developed research questions and measurable indicators for the CCT and pilot programmes. A three staged study was also undertaken with baseline, mid-term and end-term to compare evaluation parameters at all three levels and record the changes accordingly.<br/><br/>
Our work contributed in providing inputs for building robust evidence on the impact of the OGIP programme on secondary school education outcomes and social impacts, contributed for learning on cash transfer and provided lead points to Governments, Multilaterals like world Bank and UN agencies, and NGOs to design and implement conditional cash transfer programmes nationally and globally. The recommendations provided ways to improve ecosystem of G2P (Government to Persons) payments, remittances, savings and transfers. Helped in providing leads for universal financial inclusion, quicker turn-around-time for opening accounts and faster fund transfer to beneficiaries by the State government.

						           During May 2017 to October 2017, Sutra was engaged by the Tejaswini project which is implemented by Jharkhand women development Society (JWDS) supported by World Bank for a district level market study for identifying high potential wage and self-employment opportunities and skill requirement for youth in Jharkhand. The objective of the assignment was to conduct market assessment study to identify high-potential wage and self-employment opportunities and skills requirements for youth aged 16 - 24 years across all 24 districts of Jharkhand. This market assessment had strong gender focus. Young and vulnerable women in Jharkhand in particular face specific and unique challenges to enter the labor market. They are underrepresented in training, education and employment. To help close the gender gap, the market assessment diagnosed the specific constraints young women face in accessing productive work, and identify new demand-driven entry points into the labor market. <br/><br/>
In addition to this, the market assessment will not only focus on what are traditionally considered female and often less lucrative trades but also help identifying the non-traditional higher productivity and higher wage employment opportunities that young women can pursue. The market assessment study focused on skills requirements for young and vulnerable adolescent girls and women aged 16-24 for both wage and self-employment at state, district and block levels across 24 districts of Jharkhand applying a systematic methodology and field-based data collection.
