	<p class="sector-main-content">
		            Water resource sector is under severe stress to meet the demands of the growing population and the competing requirements from the economic sectors. Decreasing availability of fresh water, depleting ground water resources, land degradation, shortage of water for irrigation and increasing climate variability leading to unpredictable rainfall and shifting seasons would continue to pose serious challenges for water resource management and to thwart potential water conflicts at different levels.<br/><br/>
Our work in this sector has been focused on assisting clients and partners in design and preparation of DPR for irrigation schemes, institutional strengthening and project management consultancy, technical assistance for construction and supervision, monitoring and evaluation, environment impact assessments, training and capacity development, Participatory Irrigation Management and Irrigation Management Transfers to Water Users Associations.

					The Odisha Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Investment Programme (OIIAWMIP) was conceptualized with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to maximize the state irrigation potential and for the continued development of water resources sector. The project had a specific component of Minor Lift Irrigation Rehabilitation wherein 1400 Lift Points were to be repaired and associated agricultural training and improvement take place. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting with its consortium partner was engaged during 2009-11 in the first phase of the program as an implementation consultant for this lift irrigation component. The assignment involved feasibility study, design and DPR preparation, WUA strengthening, technical support for procurement of material and community led construction, supervision of work, water management training to farmers and post installation support. A large team of experts were deployed to support the implementation, promote agriculture intensification and institution building involving promotion of PIM and strengthening of Water Users Associations. The assignment included a strong Monitoring and Evaluation component wherein a monitoring plan was prepared and installed in the Lift irrigation Cell to review project progress and processes. The lift irrigation component was one of the successful implementation cases during first phase of the project.

				   The Government of Andhra Pradesh has proposed a next generation irrigated agriculture transformative project with climate resilience as its cross-cutting theme. The Project Development Objective is to enhance agricultural productivity, profitability and resilience to climate variability in selected tank systems of Andhra Pradesh. The project beneficiaries will include small and marginal farmers, water users associations, farmer producer organizations, and other agro-entrepreneurs. During project preparation, specific target areas will be identified and specific interventions will be designed to benefit women and other vulnerable groups. The project activities would be grouped into four main components: Improving Irrigated Agriculture Efficiency at Farm Level; Adaptive Sustainable Agriculture Practices; Climate-friendly Market and Agribusiness Promotion; and Project Management and Capacity Building.<br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting provided two sets of technical services to the programme. Our team of experts conducted a baseline assessment to study the pre-project socio-economic and institutional status of existing agricultural and fisheries-based livelihood systems in selected smallholder irrigation systems (tank systems) covering a set of project and control tanks. Our advisors also undertook identification and assessment environmental and social management measures in respect of the improving tank systems performance and resilience, improving irrigation efficiency, inflow hydrology management, improving productivity, adapting sustainable agriculture practices, innovative and technology transfer for fisheries production and agri business promotion. A number of critical programme design documents including the Tribal People Planning Framework, Gender Action Plan, Integrated Nutrition Management Plan and Environmental Management Plans were developed by our team of advisors and have been widely disseminated.
