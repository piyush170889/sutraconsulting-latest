		           Poverty reduction and livelihoods improvement continues to be the most challenging agenda for human development due to the increasing divide between the well-off and the poor and the highly inequitable growth observed across geographies. While the correlation between the economic growth and poverty reduction is apparent, it is increasingly becoming evident that it is neither proportional nor uniform. Consequently, the livelihoods sector remains prominent and a priority area for development agencies. <br/><br/>
We have extensively worked in the livelihoods and poverty reduction programmes since inception and have assisted our clients in programme design, strategy formulation for social inclusion of marginalized groups, need assessment, process design, monitoring and evaluation, social and legal reviews, designing communication strategy, capacity enhancement of institutions of poor and vulnerable groups, and improving community access to micro-credit and financial institutions.

						            International Finance Corporation's Financial Awareness project was started in the year 2013 to pilot select financial awareness programs. The goal of this project was to expand the range of financial services available to low income households (from credit to other products like Insurance, Savings, Pensions, Remittances etc.) by increasing the demand for such services. Establishing a sustainable and replicable delivery model for financial awareness, incorporating financial awareness as a strategy amongst Financial Institutions, and empowering low income households through financial awareness training to take informed decisions in selecting financial products were the key interventions of this programme in order to widen the range of financial services. <br/><br/>
Sutra was engaged as a monitoring and evaluation agency to develop and implement an Monitoring &Evaluation framework for each of the participating financial institution to monitor implementation of the financial awareness project at each participating Financial institution. Cost-benefit analysis of the financial awareness program at each participating Financial Institution, considering the cost incurred in delivering the financial awareness program and revenue generated thereof was another significant component. In addition our team was also responsible for evaluating different approaches of delivering financial awareness to assess change in financial position of the client using data captured by the participating Financial Institutions in their MIS. Our work resulted in developing a comprehensive Monitoring &Evaluation framework for the project intervention with indicators clearly identified for reporting costs incurred and revenue
