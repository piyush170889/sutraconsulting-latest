		            Increasing urbanization is creating newer challenges in urban planning, housing, service delivery of water and sanitation, power, education and healthcare, infrastructure such as road and transport, environment and regulations and management of cities. The progress of infrastructure development has also been slow in developing countries due to underinvestment, issues in land acquisition and environmental clearances resulting in serious deficits in several critical sectors such as railways, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications and power. Constraints in infrastructure is considered as a major challenge in doing business and can impact the development of private sector and reduce economic growth.<br/><br/>
Our work in this sector has been focused on urban planning and development, slum development, strengthening of utilities and urban service delivery, infrastructure and construction supervision, sector policies, GIS based plans, community engagement and social development, climate resilient urban planning, training of local bodies and design and implementation of communication plans for urban development projects.

						           During 1998-2002 DFID supported undivided Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa as part of their focus on Public Enterprise Reforms aiming at studying State Public Sector Enterprises (SPEs), looking at viable options for privatization or restricting for loss making units. DFID Orissa Public Enterprise Reforms Project (OPERP) was part of this initiative wherein the SPSEs were reviewed and various options were worked out including early retirement and Social Safety Net options for few of those.  Orissa State Road Transport Corporation (OSRTC) was one of the selected units for which structural review was carried out. ASI, UK the lead consultant was entrusted by DFID to prepare structural options report for OSRTC. <br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting was engaged by ASI, UK to make a research on road transport users and facilities in Orissa with specific reference to bus transport. The research aimed at reviewing various bus travel options for passengers in the entire state, route analysis with respect bus services and passenger load, choices of passengers, service comparison between OSRCT buses and other private players and a SWOT analysis for OSCRT.  Our experts prepared an analytical report involving identification of services that are valued by public road public transport users and conduct comparative assessment of delivery of services by Orissa State Road Transport Corporation (OSRTC) and private bus operators. It also included assessing the prevailing industry structure, competition, quality of services, user's expectations and future industry scenario. Our output went on to help making the critical suggestions by ASI's structural option report.

						           The Kolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Program of the Asian Development Bank aims to provide assistance to the project management unit of Kolkata Municipal Corporation in successfully communicating with the public about improving the quality and sustainability of water supply and sewerage operations in Kolkata Municipal Corporation area.<br/><br/>
Sutra Consulting was engaged as Public Communication and Social Development Consultant for supporting this programme. Our team of experts were responsible for developing and providing information, education and communication materials in various paper and digital formats, provide strategic advice on public communication of the project, coordinate, organize and supervise various participation and consultation activities in accordance with the communication strategy and also developing public awareness in respect of the works and area concern. Since the program has been running in selected wards there were unique challenges involved. The communication strategy and related messages had to be very niche. At one hand there was a need of project branding targeted towards the entire city of Kolkata, on another hand, there was a need to communicate effectively to the local ward residents who were potentially affected due to the construction and repair work for the project. In addition, our team was also responsible for implementation of the effective gender mainstreaming initiative under the project following the Gender Action Plan. Our work has greatly helped in conceptualizing and implementing a 360 communication cycle.

						           Sutra was entrusted with the responsibility to develop a Regional plan and strategy for up-gradation of secondary and tertiary health care facilities in North Eastern Region by 2030, provisioned under Techno Economic Development Fund administered by the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd. This will be another of the several projects being implemented by Sutra in North Eastern region. The study for developing this plan and strategy will have a wide outreach covering 8 North Eastern states namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. The primary objective of the study is to improve the reach of the quality health care facility to the people of eight North East states by the next decade. With a focus on both the supply side and demand side of the health care system the study aims to provide a strategy for overall development of secondary and tertiary health care facilities in NE region. The study will map the existing secondary and tertiary health care facility, both public and private with the help of secondary and primary information source.<br/><br/>
Other outputs from the study includes guidelines for creation of specialty centres, improvement of overall delivery system, including PPP model as well as assessment of financial requirement for up gradation of secondary and tertiary heath care facility in North East region. The methodologies adopted will be cross functional and major part of them in terms of data collection will be done through mapping exercise. A mixed method approach comprising both quantitative and qualitative tools will be administered for this study. Need of innovative and affordable health care services will be reflected by picking breakthrough case studies. These case studies will be drawn from social enterprises or private players who have brought in easy to access and affordable solutions in the health sector.
